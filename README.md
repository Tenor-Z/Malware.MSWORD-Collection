# Malware.MSWORD-Collection
A collection of malware for Microsoft Word that I have made over the years
This is where I started writing malware the most since Visual Basic was easily-accessible and can interact with computer components at ease.
Seriously, any noob can do it.

However, I do not take any responsibility for any actions that cause in destruction or tampering of machines. I'm just a programmer, not a babysitter. Educational purposes are always in effect.

The purpose of this repository is to not only educate the public on macro malware, but to also serve as a place to store my files without Windows Defender getting too fussy. Usually on newer devices, Windows turns off macros from the Internet by default, but for older technology, it's fair game. That being said, macro viruses are more limited to what they can do on newer technology nowadays, and their proper strength comes from how they can sabotage older devices. The pieces I have written have mostly been tested on Windows 95, 98, 2000, ME, and XP systems with successful results, though anything after has yet to be determined.

Scroll down to read a bit about each malware.

# YIP (pronounced yip)
YIP was the first malware that I wrote for MSWORD and it comes to show. I was around 14 or 15 when I wrote it and I guess I could not make up my mind to determine whether it would be a worm or a virus, because it has both capabilities. It is an email worm that will spread via mIRC and Outlook, and is meant to run on Windows 95 to Windows XP devices.

Whenever a document is created or loaded from the computer, YIP will call its main function, which carries out the 'main' sections of the macro virus. Closing a document will just show a pop-up message. Note: it does not infect the global document or active document. You must create a New Document after opening YIP.

The Main function will grab the user's Address Book and send the email to every contact with the YIP document attached. Therefore, everyone who opens the document will infect every contact in their Address Book, and so on and so forth. It is built to spread. To prevent it from spreading twice, YIP creates a Registry entry that will be matched with a boolean statement to make sure it doesn't spread itself more than once.

After the email spreading, it copies itself to several folders meant to be 'hidden' for normal users as a measure to keep it on the device. It will overwrite the script.ini file for mIRC to spread the document to every contact on the application.

There is a payload, which activates when the document is opened around 6:00, it will open a Youtube video to the Sausage Song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tcGyQVc__8 and overwrite Autoexec.bat with a fun little message. It finally builds and executes a Python keylogger which will log all keystrokes to a file named file_log, which can be sent to an email address or something, but I never implemented that and I don't think I will.

It's a straightforward piece of malware that can be dangerous if opened without context. It was the first macro malware I wrote.

# CCOP (Cooperation Cop/Rush)
This is a virus that spreads to other Microsoft Word documents, and is very straightforward compared to YIP. It technically overwrites each document by placing the code from the original document into other uninfected documents via copying what is open in the active document (i.e, when a user clicks on the CCOP document). This will always happen upon opening the file since the AutoOpen function will always run the infection process. The reason why CCOP has two names is primarily because CCOP apparantly already exists as a module in Microsoft Word, so I redubbed it to Rush, since it gets the job done and ceases.

# Dud
Dud is a nasty worm that personally taints every Word document it can get ahold of, leaving the message "I can officially confirm that I, indeed, have the Dud. I so proceed to pass it on to whoever desires it.". As mentioned with YIP, it also spreads via Microsoft Outlook and will find itself into the inboxes of each contact in the Address Book, along with the attached file. It will not spread more than once, with the help of checking if a specific registry key exists.

Since Dud adds text to each document it infects, this one is more easily detectable, as unintentional text can easily point to something being wrong or modified without consent. I might eventually add some anti-debugging features to it, but that is a project for another day.

Code-wise it is similar to both YIP and CCOP, but it adds its own twist by allowing text to be added, as well as antivirus measures, as it is disabled on AutoOpen.
